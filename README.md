# REST API Testing with Postman

This project is a collection of Postman tests designed to validate various REST API endpoints, including user creation, login, update, deletion, and more. The tests ensure the correctness of the APIâ€™s functionality, handling both successful and unsuccessful requests.

## Project Overview

The tests cover the following aspects of API endpoints:
- **Status codes**: Verifying that the correct HTTP status codes are returned.
- **Response formats**: Ensuring the response is in JSON format and matches the expected structure.
- **Response time**: Checking that the response time is within an acceptable range.
- **Data consistency**: Ensuring that the data returned matches the expected output.

The project includes testing for various operations such as:
- **POST Create a User**: Creating a new user and verifying the response.
- **GET Single User**: Retrieving a single user by ID and checking the response.
- **PUT Update User**: Updating an existing user and validating the updated data.
- **DELETE User**: Deleting a user and confirming successful deletion.
- **POST Register User**: Verifying successful and unsuccessful registration scenarios.
- **POST Login**: Testing the login functionality with both valid and invalid credentials.
- **GET Delayed Response**: Ensuring the API handles delayed responses properly.
